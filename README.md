This projet was made on solo and represents a contact form for a fictional Raspberry Pi accessory kits company.

The projet was made between october the 9th and the 11th , at Becode!

This web site consists in 1 main page : A costumer's contact form. It was mainly builded with bootstrap, html and php using a Localhost server (XAMPP). The purpose was to build an easy contact form developping some PHP skills employing code sanitation and validation, and displaying messages to the user. A SASS stylesheet was included for further style changes (the main variables are already adjusted to the style and are freely exchangeable according to the clients desires)

Languages which were used:
